Element is a secure social networking application and platform.
It allows for users to send and receive messages and make posts
without the server knowing who is communicating with whom or
being able to access the contents of their communication.

The completed launch video can be found here:

The website is available at https://element.tk/ when my web
server is online. The app located at https://element.tk/app/android/
should work from Google Chrome on Android.

If you want to get a copy of the APK file, the SQL data structure,
if you need me to turn on the web server for any reason, or with
any questions, don't hesitate to contact me through GitHub or
email ty.everett49 at i cloud dot_com
