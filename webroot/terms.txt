<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>Element Communications was created as the world's solution to the problem of
privacy and distraction on the internet. As such, we are obligated to protect
the privacy, anonymity, and security of all our users. In order that we achieve
this goal, Element has created this document to outline a few basic rules all
participants in our platform are to follow. Failure to follow the rules below
will result in restrictions being placed on your account, or the termination
of your account at Element's discretion.</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>Content you post to the Element platform or app should conform to the
guidelines below.</p>

offensive, derogatory, horassing, not suitable for immature audiences, or
any content that is deemed by Element to be unfit for the platform.</li>
<li><b>Illegal:</b> Do not post illegal content, or content which expressly
condones or encourages illegal activities.</li>
